            <p>following clarification from the economic affairs ministry about.Discount store group Action said it will open its 400 shops nationwide on Wednesday, following clarification from the economic affairs ministry about what counts as essential goods. Officials on Tuesday published a list of the type of shops which can remain open in the lockdown and said later that if more than 70% of turnover derives from essential goods – such as food and toiletries –  then the store can open. In addition, if the shop has various subsections devoted to non-essential items,they too can be open if they account for more than 30% of turnover. Otherwise, they should be fenced off. High street staple Hema was open on Tuesday after claiming to be the country’s biggest bakery chain, due to the popularity of its cakes and sausage rolls. It had fenced off sections of each store where clothes and household goods were on sale. Despite the clarification, retail organisation INRetail says there is much uncertainty about what counts as essential retail, following the government’s decision to close all but ‘essential’ shops. For example, shops selling books and magazines are closed, but if they have a parcel drop-off point, that can remain open. The confusion also led Labour leader Lodewijk Asscher to question the government’s rationale. ‘Action, Wibra, Makro open, small primary schools shut. Does the cabinet think this is fair?’ he said on Twitter. Broadcaster NOS reported later on Wednesday morning that ministers plan to revise the rules as soon as possible because of the confusion and concerns.
