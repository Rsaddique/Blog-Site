         <p>The Dutch public prosecution department is convinced that Dutch hacker Victor Gevers did manage to access US president Donald Trump’s Twitter account, despite White House and other doubts, the Volkskrant said on Wednesday. The paper said research by its high tech crime team showed it is clear that Gevers had logged into Trump’s account after guessing his password. ‘There has been contact with the hacker and his explanation was convincing,’ a spokesman said. The department began its investigation at the end of November to establish if a criminal offence had been committed. However, Gevers has not committed a crime because he sought contact with the White House, Twitter and the FBI and made suggestions for improvements, the public prosecutor is quoted as saying. Magazine Vrij Nederland said in October Gevers had managed to access Trump’s Twitter account for the second time, after first gaining access with two other hackers four years ago. The VN account, also published in English, says that Gevers guessed Trump’s password was maga2020! in just seven attempts and that the president had switched off the two stage authentication process which should have been in place. The Dutch investigation in the Netherlands was an independent Dutch probe and had not been requested by the US.
